-- Highlander's rules, the hl.rules add-on: each worm is dealt one weapon
-- from each pool, may use each once a turn, and takes everything a worm it
-- kills carried (scheme/pools, scheme/state, scheme/highland_rules), wherever the
-- profile put the weapons. It installs before the weapons (before_weapons),
-- so its hooks run first.
--
-- The pools are the placed weapons' settings for this add-on ("Highlander
-- pool", "Dealt on cavern maps"): a PX weapon suggests its PX pool in
-- mod.toml, and a profile may set any weapon's, a stock one's too.
--
-- What PX gives outside the deal -- the Hot Air Balloons refilled to 3 and
-- the Wind Changer to 1 each turn, one Weapon Crate a round -- is weapon data
-- in the Highlander profile, which the loader shows and a player may change.
