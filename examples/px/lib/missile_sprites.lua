-- For some weapons PX draws the missile itself (p_sprite_builder,
-- WeapSprite) and leaves WA's sprite 0: a sprite that follows the missile,
-- turned to its flight, mirrored when it flies left, and, if `animate`,
-- stepped through its sheet as a hold is. Here it is a GPU actor per
-- missile, placed from wa.on.missile_frame after WA has moved the missile.
-- It reads m.weapon (the missile's slot); on an engine without it nothing
-- matches and nothing is drawn. With `hide`, WA draws nothing for the
-- missile (m.sprite = 0), as PX's sprite 0 does; its record keeps its
-- sprite, which a thrown weapon's worm posture is picked by.
--
-- How it turns follows the record's animation type (the entry's +0x64,
-- PX's launchdata.anim.type): 2, WAT_TrackMovement, faces its flight
-- (WeapSprite type 2, as a bazooka shell); 1, WAT_Rotation, spins with its
-- speed (type 3, as a grenade), which `spin` asks for.

-- Slot -> the weapon's WeapSpriteParams, as its PX script states them.
